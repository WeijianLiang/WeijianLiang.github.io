## 🌟 Openings @ **Computational Particle Methods Laboratory**, Shenzhen University

Build real simulations, write impactful code, and turn ideas into working models—while living in **Shenzhen**, one of China’s most vibrant innovation hubs.  
The **Computational Particle Methods Laboratory** at **Shenzhen University** warmly welcomes motivated, hands-on students and researchers.

### Research Focus (What We Simulate & Discover)
- **Intricate granular media behavior** (from micro-mechanics to emergent macroscopic response)
- **Offshore geotechnics** (seabed response, foundations, and marine geohazards)
- **Fluid–soil interaction** (coupled multiphase processes, seepage, erosion, liquefaction-related phenomena)

### Methods & Tools
- LBM (Lattice Boltzmann Method)
- MPM (Material Point Method)
- DEM (Discrete Element Method)

### Openings
- Master’s students (MSc)
- PhD students (PhD)
- Research Assistant (RA)
- Postdoctoral Researcher (Postdoc)

### What to Send
