## 1. Multiscale modeling of granular media

The behavior of granular is among the most perplexing phenomena that attract sustained interests from science and engineering. The response of granular media is determined by their underlying structure. Weijian strives to establish a multiscale computational framework for granular media, which enables:

* Handling large deformation in geotechnical problems;
* Capturing microstructural evolution inside sample;
* Considering particle morphology;
* Direct information transfer across multiple scales.

## 2. Contact Algorithm for Mesh-free Approach

Contact algorithm is one of the challenging aspects of mesh free approaches like MPM. Weijian strives to devise robust contact algorithm for meshless method for improving their capbility in model complex problems. See below for our proposed dual-mortar based contact algorithm for MPM.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="max-width: 750px; margin: auto;"> 
        {% include figure.html path="images/slip_animation.gif" title="" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
        {% include figure.html path="images/stick_animation.gif" title="" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    <div class="caption center">
        <h3>Ball on inclined plane in slip (top) and stick (bottom) conditions</h3>
    </div>
</div>
</div>



## 3. Mesh-free Methods and High-performance computing

Weijian also endeavors to devise innovative scheme for meshless method (e.g., Material Point Method) and high-performance computing for leveraging the computational efficiency, fully unleashing their capacity. Those attempts include:

* Proposing semi-implicit integration scheme for hydro-mechanical MPM;
* Designing flat-MPI parallelism scheme for MPM-DEM approach;
* Porting the multiscale approach onto Tianhe2 supercomputer.
