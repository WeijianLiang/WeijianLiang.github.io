## 1. Multiscale modeling of granular media

The behavior of granular is among the most perplexing phenomena that attract sustained interests from science and engineering. The response of granular media is determined by their underlying structure. Weijian strives to establish a multiscale computational framework for granular media, which enables:

* Handling large deformation in geotechnical problems;
* Capturing microstructural evolution inside sample;
* Considering particle morphology;
* Direct information transfer across multiple scales.

## 2. Mesh-free Methods and High-performance computing

Weijian also endeavors to devise innovative scheme for meshless method (e.g., Material Point Method) and high-performance computing for leveraging the computational efficiency, fully unleashing their capacity. Those attempts include:

* Proposing semi-implicit integration scheme for hydro-mechanical MPM;
* Designing flat-MPI parallelism scheme for MPM-DEM approach;
* Porting the multiscale approach onto Tianhe2 supercomputer.
