Welcome to my homepage! 

I am Weijian Liang (梁伟健 in Chinese) and I was born and raised in [Shunde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunde_District), a [Creative City of Gastronomy](https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/shunde). 

Currently, I am a [Professor at Shenzhen University](https://facultyce.szu.edu.cn/liangweijian/zh_CN/index.htm). I received my B.Eng. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) in 2016, and my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2020. During my Ph.D. studies, I spent half a year as a research exchange scholar at UC Berkeley.

After completing my Ph.D., I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Computational Granular Mechanics Lab](http://jzhao.people.ust.hk/) for two years. Prior to joining Shenzhen University, I served as a [Research Assistant Professor](http://www.geoinvention.com/) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) for three years.

My current research interests include:
* Multiscale and multiphysics modeling of granular materials
* Mesh-free methods, including integration schemes, contact algorithms, and stabilization techniques
* High-performance computing for advanced numerical simulations
* Hybrid methods, such as MPM-LBM coupling
