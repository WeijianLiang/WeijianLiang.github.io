Welcome to my homepage! 

I am Weijian Liang (梁伟健 in Chinese) and I was born and raised in [Shunde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunde_District), a [Creative City of Gastronomy](https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/shunde). 

I obtained my B.Eng in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) in 2016 and earned my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2020. During my Ph.D. study, I took a half year research exchange at UC Berkeley. After my graduation, I stayed at [Computational Granular Mechanics Lab](http://jzhao.people.ust.hk/) as a postdoc for two years. From July 2022, I joined the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) as a [Research Assistant Professor](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/people/academic-staff/dr-weijian-liang/). 

My current research interest focuses on developing high-performance multi-scale and multi-physics approaches for modeling granular material.
